/** A button that uses a Gio::Action as model.
 *
 * ModelButton is a button class that can use a Gio::Action as its model.
 * In contrast to ToggleButton or RadioButton, which can also
 * be backed by a Gio::Action via Actionable::property_action_name(),
 * ModelButton will adapt its appearance according to the kind of
 * action it is backed by, and appear either as a plain, check or radio button.
 *
 * Model buttons are used with popovers from a menu model bound to the popover.
 * They can also be used manually in a PopoverMenu.
 *
 * When the action is specified via Actionable::property_action_name()
 * and Actionable::property_action_target(), the role of the button
 * (i.e. whether it is a plain, check or radio button) is determined by
 * the type of the action and doesn't have to be explicitly specified
 * with property_role().
 *
 * The content of the button is specified by property_text() and property_icon().
 *
 * The appearance of model buttons can be influenced with
 * property_centered() and property_iconic().
 *
 * Model buttons have built-in support for submenus in PopoverMenu.
 * To make a ModelButton that opens a submenu when activated, set
 * property_menu_name(). To make a button that goes
 * back to the parent menu, you should set property_inverted()
 * to place the submenu indicator at the opposite side.
